# layer 7 load balancer
# by default k8 doesnt have ingress controller
# u can use nginx or traefik or Contour or HAProxy or Istio
# ingress controller is a pod that runs in the cluster
# it watches for ingress resources and configures the load balancer accordingly
# it can route traffic based on the host and path
# it can also terminate SSL/TLS
# it can also do SSL offloading
# it can also do SSL re-encryption
# it can also do SSL passthrough
# it can also do SSL re-routing
# it can also do SSL redirect
# it can also do SSL re-write
# it can also serve as a reverse proxy
